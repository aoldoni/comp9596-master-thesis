UNSW Dissertation
=================

This is my thesis for a Natural Language Processing supervised by Dr. Wei Wang at UNSW.

Abstract
========

This research provides a method for extracting information from academic text from the databases domain, using a verb as a query. The amount of latent information in documents in non-structured format or natural language texts is known to be very large, and this is motivation for the development of methods that are able to bring this information into a structured format that can be computationally useful. Most of the academic output is provided in different formats, mostly PDF (Portable Document Format), and contain a very large amount of information and comparison across methods and techniques. We chose to use language models to extract language information, such as part-of-speech tags or dependency trees, and use sets of rules to output a relation in the Relation(Arg1, Arg2, Argn) format. Our results correctness, for the types of relation we propose to extract, are comparable to other existing tools.
